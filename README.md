# OllieBotWeb
A simple socket server for the domain <a href="https://olliebot.cc">olliebot.cc</a>, built from scratch

# Purpose
This server provides an informative website for the Discord bot OllieBot, as well as content hosting and media processing. Https will be added soon, but it's not a top priority, as this site handles no sensitive information currently.

# Design
This server is a simple asyncronous socket i/o system. You may notice I'm writing the http myself, and that's mostly for fun/learning.
Suggestions are welcome.

The top-level file is <a href="https://github.com/CantSayIHave/OllieBotWeb/blob/master/asyerver.py">asyerver.py</a>
