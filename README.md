# OllieBotWeb v2
A simple server for the domain <a href="https://olliebot.cc">olliebot.cc</a>

# Purpose
This server provides an informative website for the Discord bot OllieBot, as well as content hosting and media processing.

# Design
This server is a simple python http implementation, currently on threading. Will probably switch to an async implementation sooner or later (gotta learn that first :)

The top-level file is <a href="https://github.com/CantSayIHave/OllieBotWeb/blob/master/servercore.py">asyerver.py</a>
