# OllieBotWeb
A simple socket server for the domain <a href="https://olliebot.cc">olliebot.cc</a>, built from scratch

# Purpose
This server provides an informative website for the Discord bot OllieBot, as well as content hosting and media processing. Https will be added soon, but it's not a top priority, as this site handles no sensitive information currently.

# Design
This is by no means the easiest way to build a server, but it serves as an educational "reinventing-the-wheel" type of project and also allows full control over content and functionality.
Suggestions are welcome, but may not be implemented.
